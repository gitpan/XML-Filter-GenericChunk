XML::Filter::GenericChunk

XML::Filter::GenericChunk is a base class for SAX filters that are able to
parse wellballanced chunks from SAX events and transforms this chunk
into a sequence of SAX events.

This package also implements a second module:
XML::Filter::CharacterChunk, which is a basicly a sample
implementation, that collects all data from characters() events and
generates SAX events from this data as it would be a normal XML
section.

The Module requires XML::SAX and XML::LibXML 1.4 or higher

The installation is easy and should not cause any problems :-)

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
# and (as superuser)
make install
